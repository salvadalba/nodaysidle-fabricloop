Project Name: FabricLoop
A B2B circular economy marketplace connecting textile manufacturers with fashion brands to trade "deadstock" (excess fabric) and pre-consumer waste.

The Twist: The "Material Passport." Every roll of fabric listed generates a Digital Product Passport (DPP) containing its full carbon footprint, water usage, and chemical composition. This allows brands to filter not just by color or price, but by "Scope 3 Emission Compliance," effectively automating their sustainability reporting.

Tech Stack & Key Specs:
Infrastructure: DigitalOcean (Droplets) or Render for a developer-friendly, non-big-tech cloud approach.

Backend: Go (Golang) for high-throughput transaction handling.

Search Engine: Elasticsearch (Self-hosted or via Elastic Cloud) for granular filtering of millions of SKUs.

Authentication: Auth0 (owned by Okta) or Keycloak (Open Source) instead of Firebase Auth.
