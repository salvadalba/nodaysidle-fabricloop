# FabricLoop

## 🎯 Product Vision
A B2B circular economy marketplace that transforms textile waste into a valuable resource while automating sustainability compliance through digital product passports.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Textile manufacturers hold millions of dollars in deadstock fabric that goes to waste, while fashion brands struggle to source sustainable materials and accurately report Scope 3 emissions. Current manual processes for sustainability reporting are error-prone, expensive, and lack verifiable data.

## 🎯 Goals
- Create a liquid marketplace for deadstock textile trading
- Automate Scope 3 emission reporting for fashion brands through verifiable digital passports
- Reduce textile waste by diverting excess fabric to production use
- Provide transparent environmental impact data for every material transaction

## 🚫 Non-Goals
- Direct-to-consumer sales
- Finished garment marketplace
- Post-consumer textile recycling
- Blockchain or cryptocurrency integration
- Mobile applications in phase one

## 👥 Target Users
- Textile manufacturers with excess inventory
- Fashion brands seeking sustainable materials
- Sustainability officers needing compliance data
- Supply chain managers

## 🧩 Core Features
- Material listing and search with granular filtering
- Digital Product Passport generation per material SKU
- Carbon footprint, water usage, and chemical composition tracking
- Scope 3 emission compliance filtering
- Buyer-seller messaging and transaction workflow
- Sustainability report export (CSV, PDF, API)
- User authentication and role-based access

## ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

- User retention rate after first transaction

## 📌 Assumptions
- Users have reliable internet access
- Manufacturers can provide basic material composition data
- Brands prioritize sustainability in sourcing decisions
- Regulatory pressure on Scope 3 reporting will increase
- Users are comfortable with web-based applications

## ❓ Open Questions
